(API) Rate limiting requests in CakePHP 3

This plugin allows you to limit the number of requests a client can make to your
app in a given time frame.

## Requirements

- CakePHP 3.0+
- CakePHP cache engine with support for atomic updates

## Installation

```
composer require muffin/throttle
```
To make your application load the plugin either run:

```bash
./bin/cake plugin load Muffin/Throttle
```

or add the following line to ``config/bootstrap.php``:

```php
Plugin::load('Muffin/Throttle');
```

## Configuration

In your `config/app.php` add a cache config named `throttle` under the `Cache` key
with required config. For e.g.:

```php
'throttle' => [
    'className' => 'Apc',
    'prefix' => 'throttle_'
],
```

**Note:** This plugin will **NOT** work when using the `File` cache engine as it
does not support atomic increment.

\
\
**Using the Dispatch Filter**

In `bootstrap.php`:

Include the class namespace:

```php
use Cake\Routing\DispatcherFactory;
```

Add a configuration:

```php
DispatcherFactory::add('Muffin/Throttle.Throttle');
```

This will use the defaults, 10 requests per minute for any given IP. You could
easily change that by passing your own configuration:

```php
DispatcherFactory::add('Muffin/Throttle.Throttle', [
    'message' => 'Rate limit exceeded',
    'interval' => '+1 hour',
    'limit' => 300,
    'identifier' => function (Request $request) {
        if (null !== $request->header('Authorization')) {
            return str_replace('Bearer ', '', $request->header('Authorization'));
        }
        return $request->clientIp();
    }
]);
```

The above example would allow 300 requests/hour/token and would first try to
identify the client by JWT Bearer token before falling back to
(Throttle default) IP address based identification.

**Using the Middleware**

**Note:** This requires Cakephp version 3.4 or greater.  

Include the middleware in inside of the Application.php:
```php
use Muffin\Throttle\Middlware\ThrottleMiddleware;
```

Add the middleware to the stack and pass your custom configuration:
```php
public function middleware($middleware)
{
    // Various other middlewares for error handling, routing etc. added here.
     
    $throttleMiddleware = new ThrottleMiddleware([
        'message' => 'Rate limit exceeded',
        'interval' => '+1 hour',
        'limit' => 300,
        'identifier' => function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
            if (null !== $request->header('Authorization')) {
                return str_replace('Bearer ', '', $request->header('Authorization'));
            }
            return $request->clientIp();
        }
    ]);
    
    $middlewareQueue->add($throttleMiddleware);
    
    return $middlewareQueue;
}
```
The above example would allow 300 requests/hour/token and would first try to identify the client by JWT Bearer token before falling back to (Throttle default) IP address based identification. 

### X-headers

By default Throttle will add X-headers with rate limiting information
to all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 7
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1438434161
```

To customize the header names simply pass (all of them) to your configuration:

```php
DispatcherFactory::add('Muffin/Throttle.Throttle', [
    'headers' => [
        'limit' => 'X-MyRateLimit-Limit',
        'remaining' => 'X-MyRateLimit-Remaining',
        'reset' => 'X-MyRateLimit-Reset'
    ]
]);
```

To disable the headers pass ``false``:

```php
DispatcherFactory::add('Muffin/Throttle.Throttle', [
    'headers' => false
]);
```

## Patches & Features

* Fork
* Mod, fix
* Test - this is important, so it's not unintentionally broken
* Commit - do not mess with license, todo, version, etc. (if you do change any, bump them into commits of
their own that I can ignore when I pull)
* Pull request - bonus point for topic branches

To ensure your PRs are considered for upstream, you MUST follow the CakePHP coding standards.
